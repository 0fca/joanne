# joanne
Simple, cross-platform, light desktop gallery.

**The need of better using experience**

I have started coding Joanne on Windows 10, because of very poor optimization of MS Photos. 
The time MS Photos needed to load just one photo was too long for me sometimes. In some cases I wanted more information about the image or just a simple gallery view with smooth scrolling. 

**Why Java**

Just because it was the only language I knew enough good for it.

**Advantages**

Joanne is:
* full cross-platform,
* is lighter and faste than MS Photos,
* shows EXIF data,
* opens all formats Java can open; jpeg,png,bmp, gif,
* optimized thumbs list(tested while vieweing folder of 6k photos, 400x300 was avg size),
* thumbnail list sorting options,
* Google Drive sync.

**Disadvantages**

The real usage of RAM is much lower than the RAM taken by JVM, cannot do anything about this...

**Incoming features**

I want to complete Google Drive sync, optimize sorting options and sort out the main view's layout of the application.
